Hi, I'm Saumyaa, a passionate developer with a strong interest in software developement and problem solving.
 I specialize in Java, Python and C and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.
 Currently, I'm exploring abstract data types and algorithm, which I find both challenging and exciting.
 I enjoy building projects.
 My repositories will showcase a variety of code, starting from a basic program like adding numbers to more advanced projects, demonstrating my growth as a developer.
 In addition to coding, I design posters for events and create digital art, blending creativity with technology.
 My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to projects that have a real world impact.
 Feel free to check out my repositories.
